# UCSC-Deep-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence
labs from UCSC DBDA.X425 Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Course

Lab 6 is the culmination of the course with creating a model, deploying it to a docker container, and testing with Postman.

I am running JupyterLab, docker, and minikube locally.
