# UCSC-Deep-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence
labs from UCSC DBDA.X425 Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Course

Lab 6 is the culmination of the course with creating a model, deploying it to a docker container, and testing with Postman.

I am running JupyterLab, docker, and minikube locally.  Your result may vary.

UcscDBDAX425Assignment1BW - Create an Artificial Neural Network Model for Fashion Dataset using Sequential model.

UcscDBDAX425Assignment2FUNCTBW - Create an Artificial Neural Network Model for Fashion Dataset using Functional model.

UcscDBDAX425Assign3CallBkBW - Create a Neural Network Model by creating Sequential API and invoke additional callback functions in the model.fit(). Please see Instructions below.

UcscDBDAX425Assign4CiFar100CNN_BW - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Model using CIFAR100 Dataset

UcscDBDAX425Assign5Spam_colab_BW - Create a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Model and then deploying the Model in Docker Container

UcscDBDAX425Assign6BERT_BW - Create a BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of plain-text IMDB movie reviews.  Train and save the model. Deploy the model into a docker container and submit phrases to be evaluated by the model
